"""lolqueue.py - QUEUE CALL: the stop/go verdict, delivered before you press Find Match.

The single cheapest source of LP per hour in solo queue is not playing the games you were
going to lose. Everyone knows the folklore ("don't queue on tilt"); almost nobody knows
their OWN numbers, and the numbers are the only thing that makes the call obeyable.

Per-Ax already computes these splits - lolprofile._patterns() slices your history by
after-a-loss, deep-sitting and time-of-day - but it renders them on the profile page,
which you open *after* the session that cost you the LP. This module answers the same
question at the one moment it can change a decision: you're sitting in the lobby with the
cursor over Find Match.

House rules (same spirit as docs/TAGS.md - a claim must carry its evidence):
  - Every line cites YOUR games: "after 2+ losses · 24% over 17 (vs 47% otherwise)".
  - A verdict needs a bucket that beats a two-proportion z-test against the games OUTSIDE
    it (see _z_worse) AND a >=GAP_STOP point gap. A cold patch that hasn't cleared that bar
    renders as "leaning cold" and does NOT change the verdict.
  - No sample, no claim. Under MIN_BASE games it says so and gets out of the way.

Sources, in order: the League client's own match history (keyless, never rate-limited),
then lolprofile's behavior ledger on disk (so the call still works with the client shut).
