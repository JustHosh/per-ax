"""lolugg.py — u.gg match-history FALLBACK for the scout.

Riot's Match-V5 API lives on the regional host (americas.api.riotgames.com), which
Cloudflare-blocks or rate-limits often enough that the scout sometimes sees ZERO recent
games for a player who very much has them — the loading board then reads "no recent
ranked" for the whole lobby. u.gg runs its own match indexer, so when Riot's history
call comes back empty we ask u.gg for the same recent ranked games (champ, W/L, KDA,
role, match id, a carry score) and normalize them to the EXACT shape lolscout.scout()
builds from Riot data. So the pipeline is: try Riot first, fall back to u.gg.

Best-effort and defensive by construction: any network / shape hiccup returns [] and the
scout simply behaves as if there were no games (identical to a Riot miss), never raising
into its caller. Solo-queue only, to mirror the scout's queue=420 focus.

Endpoint + response shape verified live against u.gg's public GraphQL API
(POST https://u.gg/api) — see docs / the getPlayerMatchSummaries operation.
